# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Mark Bukovich. I grew up in the Dallas area with many interests. Ultimately I have found programming and development to be one of my favorite things to do, so now I am taking my computer science journey seriously. I will be using github as a way to keep track of and share my projects.
